Server/web view is almost done, 99%. Port translation has been done at Thomas', we have the following

8080 -> index.php
3306 -> db access
8021 -> ftp server

Everything is accessible on the domain sampang.internet-box.ch and through phpmyadmin.co

Vincent is working on the WIFI module, which is not the library supported one, it's called Wifly, and he has to communicate with it in UART.

I'm starting the Android app as a master/detail app, connection to the DB will use jdbc, with a mysql provided driver, which has been included as a dependency in the android project. DB connection test has been done.

Everything will communicate with the PI server.

For the android app, we have to check if we really use an hashmap of coordinates, time or we just use the count provided by the DB.

TODO: add data validation when creating a coordinate

Otherwise the DBconnector which gets the data from our DB and returns a list of run in the end is done normally.
