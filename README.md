#RunningWasp

We use a Waspmote with a GPS module to log running data and sending them using GPRS or WIFI to a webserver hosted on a Raspberry PI apache server.

We then have a web interface to look at the stats and the data. We also made an Android app to display the data as well. You can find the apk in the releases (if the server has been shut down, it will not work).

With ❤️ from Geneva.
